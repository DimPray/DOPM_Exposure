                                                     by Dingming Zhang, Xinyu Wang, Wanqiang Yao, and Yanfei Zhong

This is support code of our paper "A demographic optimization proximity model for air pollution exposure assessment".

**Applications:**

1. designed a novel age-guided virtual receptors
2. replicated GWFPM in assessing air pollution exposure
3. improved DOPM in assessing air pollution exposure
4. predicted exposure intensity of individual receptor

**Requirements:**

1. python >= 3.8
2. Please download the sample data from this link before proceeding: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CesdXewOYz9hQ1QktIpYv3KKcbYf9MRf?usp=sharing

**Notification:**

1. Please reproduce the process by following the code in the given order.
2. Each python code can be run independently.
3. Some of the code outputs need to be visualized in ArcMap. Please refer to the paper for guidance on how to reproduce these results.
